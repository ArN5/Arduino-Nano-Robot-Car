# Arduino-Nano-Robot-Car
This is for a class being taught at San Diego City Robotics, in which a low cost Arduino Nano base PCB that contains the L293D motor controller is used for basic robotics. The files will be open to the public along with the Arduino lessons and code. 


L293d_module.brd is the board file for a L293D module which was milled out on an othermill.
It just a simple module for 2 motors.

NanoBase_L293D.brd is a arduino nano module
which has a L293D module with screw terminals, made primarily to control some motors and be used as a simple robot platform.
